# Portfolio: Product & Supply Chain Operator

A high-precision, technical landing page for a Canada-based Product & Supply Chain Operator specializing in fit-sensitive apparel (Lingerie, Shapewear, Sports Bras).

## 🎯 Project Objective
This site is designed to communicate "Operational Depth" over "Consulting Theater." It serves as a diagnostic gateway for fashion brands struggling with structural fit issues, rising returns, and supply chain bottlenecks.

## 🛠 Design Language: "The Technical Blueprint"
To reflect the "Operator" identity, the site utilizes an industrial-minimalist aesthetic:
- **Grid System:** A CSS-generated 40px grid background mimicking engineering graph paper.
- **Typography:** - `Playfair Display` for authoritative headers.
  - `IBM Plex Mono` for technical labels and status codes.
  - `Inter` for high-legibility body text.
- **Visuals:** Zero stock photography; relies on technical line art and layout precision to convey expertise.

## 🚀 Quick Deployment
This is a lightweight, zero-dependency HTML/CSS project optimized for **GitHub Pages**.

1. **Clone/Download** this repository.
2. Ensure `index.html` is in the root directory.
3. Push to GitHub and enable **GitHub Pages** via `Settings > Pages`.

## ⚙️ Customization (Action Required)
To make this site functional for your use, update the following placeholders in `index.html`:

- **Email Links:** Search for `mailto:your@email.com` and replace with your professional address.
- **Geographic Signature:** In the footer, update the `LATITUDE/LONGITUDE` if your base of operations changes.
- **Chinese Endorsement:** Ensure the Quote block in the `About` section accurately reflects your specific value proposition.
